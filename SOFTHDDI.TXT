SOFTHDDI
Software Hard Disk Drive Indicators for DOS
Provides simulated hard disk activity "LED"s and seeking sounds.
Intended for MS-DOS systems with solid-state hard drives that lack both,
so that disk activity can again be seen/heard.

Three hard disk "indicators" are available, and can be enabled in any
combination:

- An on-screen "LED" that appears in the upper left corner
- An audible "click" that simulates HDD head seek noise
- Keyboard CAPSLOCK/NUMLOCK/SCROLLLOCK indicator LEDs

Run "SOFTHDDI" with no arguments to see command-line usage.
